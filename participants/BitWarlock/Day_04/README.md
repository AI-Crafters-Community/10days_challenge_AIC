# Virtual Try-on

## Making The Outfit

I wanted to create some fun and unique outfits, so I used Gemini to generate them.  
The prompt I gave was simple:

> A single unique outfit on a white background, with this style: Harry Potter

This is the outfit Gemini gave me:

It was quite creative and gave a magical feeling, just like the Harry Potter style I asked for.  

## Virtual Try-on

After making the outfit, I wanted to see how it would look if someone actually wore it.  
To do this, I tested different websites that allow "virtual try-on" of clothes.  
Here are the ones I tried:

- https://vtry.io  
- https://mycleverai.com  
- https://app.klingai.com  
- https://huggingface.co/spaces/Kwai-Kolors/Kolors-Virtual-Try-On  

Out of all of these, I felt that this one worked the best:  
https://fitroom.app  

It gave me this result when I tried the outfit on a portrait:

The portrait I used was one I found online:

## Challenges

While testing, I noticed some challenges with virtual try-on tools.  
They are often limited, especially when it comes to head accessories like hats, glasses, or other things worn on the head.  
Another problem is that many times the outfit needs to be in a certain format (for example, only the top, only the bottom, or both separated) for the tool to give a better result.  

Overall, the results were interesting but not always perfect.
