# Music Generation

I used [Suno](https://suno.com/home) (which gives you 60 credits — 10 credits for each prompt, and each prompt generates 4 songs). In my opinion it's the best at generating music, although it unfortunately does not support Arabic vocals.  

You can also try:  
- [Boomy](https://boomy.com/) — Has a simple design, supports adding lyrics, but it's limited in terms of editing the music and trying multiple styles.  
- [Udio](https://www.udio.com/) — Gives 120 credits (2 credits for each prompt — generates 2 songs). Second best after Suno, but it does not generate long songs and often creates generic music. It does, however, have funny random prompts XD.

> Fusion of Oum Kalthoum’s Arabic orchestral style (oud, qanun, violins, Arabic vocal phrasing) with Metallica’s heavy metal sound (distorted guitars, thrash drums, deep bass). 90's style, pop/rock.
