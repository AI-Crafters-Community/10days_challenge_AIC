# 🧠 AI Agents – Notebook Guide  

This notebook introduces the concept of **AI Agents**—LLMs enhanced with tools, memory, and structured decision-making to go beyond the limitations of standalone models.  

---

## 📖 Overview  

Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful, but they come with key limitations:  
- **Hallucinations** – Confidently generating incorrect answers.  
- **Knowledge Cutoff** – Limited to training data, unaware of recent events.  
- **Data Privacy** – Cannot access private or proprietary information.  

**AI Agents** overcome these limitations by combining:  
- **LLM** – The core reasoning and language capabilities.  
- **Tools** – APIs, external functions, and data sources.  
- **Memory** – Context and recall across interactions.  

This creates agents that can plan, act, and adapt while solving complex tasks.

## ⚙️ How It Works  

An AI Agent follows a structured **decision-making loop**:  

1. **Think / Plan** – Analyze the request and design a step-by-step approach.  
2. **Act** – Execute actions using external tools with the right inputs.  
3. **Observe** – Evaluate the outcome and adjust if necessary.  

This cycle repeats until the task is complete or no further progress is possible.

## 🎯 Try It Yourself  

In this notebook, you’ll get hands-on with your own AI agent. Test it with:  

1. 🔎 Asking about different research papers  
2. 🌦 Checking weather in another city  
3. ➗ Solving more complex math problems  
4. 🌍 Searching for something fun or interesting  

💡 *Tip: The more specific your query, the better the results!*

## 🚀 What’s Next?  

After finishing this notebook, here are some ways to keep going:  
- Add more tools to your agent (e.g., APIs, databases).  
- Experiment with different LLMs.  
- Build specialized agents for research, support, or coding.

## 📦 Requirements  

Make sure you have the following installed:  

- Python 3.8+  
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab  
- `google-generativeai` (Gemini Python SDK)  
- `requests` (for API calls)  
- Any additional libraries used in the notebook  

Have fun 🤩
```bash
pip install google-generativeai requests
